### Idea:

### How It Works
After signing up and storing your contact information, we allow users to choose a new trip. From there, users can pick a contact method: email, text, or phone call to receive an alarm. After declaring how far in advance of arrival users would like to be woken up, they can press the submit button to be notified that specified amount of time before arrival.

### Challenges
* How do we get reliable alarms sent to a phone via a web app?
* Grabbing Most Common End Destinations
* Using Twilio for the first time
* Using Google Maps for the first time

### Approach
We decided the best way to get the functionality of a native app would be to use the Twilio API to call our users. The other important feature was accurately calculating the amount of time to get somewhere, particularly on public transportation, so we decided that the Google Maps api would be best for that.
